Pull Requests
-------------

Pull requests are welcome, please include a test case where possible:

* For small changes (under a file in size) a committer can apply the fix on your behalf.

* For changes over one file in size we ask that you add your details (or your employer details) in the file ``__copyright__``).

We trust you (and your employer) understand the `MIT License<LICENSE.txt>`_ used by gsconfig. This is why we asks you note your copyright details above.
